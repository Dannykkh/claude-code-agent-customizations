# Skill Judge - 상세 평가 기준

## Common Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Tutorial
```
Symptom: Explains what PDF is, how Python works, basic library usage
Root cause: Author assumes Skill should "teach" the model
Fix: Claude already knows this. Delete all basic explanations.
     Focus on expert decisions, trade-offs, and anti-patterns.
```

### Pattern 2: The Dump
```
Symptom: SKILL.md is 800+ lines with everything included
Root cause: No progressive disclosure design
Fix: Core routing and decision trees in SKILL.md (<300 lines ideal)
     Detailed content in references/, loaded on-demand
```

### Pattern 3: The Orphan References
```
Symptom: References directory exists but files are never loaded
Root cause: No explicit loading triggers
Fix: Add "MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE" at workflow decision points
     Add "Do NOT Load" to prevent over-loading
```

### Pattern 4: The Checkbox Procedure
```
Symptom: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3... mechanical procedures
Root cause: Author thinks in procedures, not thinking frameworks
Fix: Transform into "Before doing X, ask yourself..."
     Focus on decision principles, not operation sequences
```

### Pattern 5: The Vague Warning
```
Symptom: "Be careful", "avoid errors", "consider edge cases"
Root cause: Author knows things can go wrong but hasn't articulated specifics
Fix: Specific NEVER list with concrete examples and non-obvious reasons
```

### Pattern 6: The Invisible Skill
```
Symptom: Great content but skill rarely gets activated
Root cause: Description is vague, missing keywords, or lacks trigger scenarios
Fix: Description must answer WHAT, WHEN, and include KEYWORDS

BAD:  "Helps with document tasks"
GOOD: "Create, edit, and analyze .docx files. Use when working with
       Word documents, tracked changes, or professional document formatting."
```

### Pattern 7: The Wrong Location
```
Symptom: "When to use this Skill" section in body, not in description
Root cause: Misunderstanding of three-layer loading
Fix: Move all triggering information to description field
     Body is only loaded AFTER triggering decision is made
```

### Pattern 8: The Over-Engineered
```
Symptom: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
Root cause: Treating Skill like a software project
Fix: Delete all auxiliary files. Only include what Agent needs.
```

### Pattern 9: The Freedom Mismatch
```
Symptom: Rigid scripts for creative tasks, vague guidance for fragile operations
Root cause: Not considering task fragility
Fix: High freedom for creative (principles, not steps)
     Low freedom for fragile (exact scripts, no parameters)
```
